//MOV type R
//Cause it only uses registers
// Needs to pass what's in register a to register b
// It could be done with load word
// We load from register a, to register b


//MULTPLUS type I
//Register plus immediate, could be seen as a multiplication with an addition
//First we multiply the register b times c, then another ALU adds the result plus one
//Finally saved in the register file

//INC type I
//Resgiter a is add with itself plus one
